A Movie Recommender System Based on Content-Based Filtering Done Using Python
Content-based Recommendation System 
Content-based filtering is a widely used technique in recommendation systems. In this approach, the system leverages the features and preferences you've given to suggest items that align with your interests. It draws upon the data you've shared online and any information it can gather to offer personalized recommendations.

The fundamental idea behind content-based filtering is to categorize products using specific keywords, learn about your preferences, search for those terms in its database, and propose similar items. This type of recommender system heavily relies on user inputs. Examples of platforms using content-based filtering include Google and Wikipedia.
